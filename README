# ScalateToAsciidoc
Migrates Scalates to Asciidoc

To change the directory you want to process, you should change the property in ScalateToAsciidoc.properties. The migration only processes ".conf" files.
The generated files are stored next to the files it processes.

The migration of tables is not included. (Feel free to contribute if you want to tackle this!)
